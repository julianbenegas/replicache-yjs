# replicache-yjs

The goal of this repo is to show how to use YJS with replicache.

This was forked from replicache-todo

It currently uses codemirror-yjs for the text editor but the goal is for the integration points to only use YJS and not be codemirror specific so that other usages of YJS will work out of the box.

This also supports "awareness". YJS's terminology for presence, cursors and other ephemeral data. The Awareness needs more work.

## To get started

Follow the instructions in the [Replicache Getting Started Guide](https://doc.replicache.dev/).
